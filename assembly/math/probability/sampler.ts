   * Generates an observation using the rejection sampling method.
   *
   * This method uses a uniform random function to generate:
   *  - the number k, the potential observation
   *  - the number x, an alea
   *
   *  If the number x is lower or equal to the probability of event k,
   *  then it's an observation.
   *
   *  Otherwise, the process is restarted (k and x are generated).
   *
   *  This process can be describe using the following schema with:
   *   - observations in abscissa (from 0 to 4)
   *   - probability for each observation in ordinate (observation 2 having
   *   the greatest probability p_max)
   *
   *  p_max ────┬─┬────
   *            │ │ ┌─┐
   *          ┌─┤ │ │ │
   *        ┌─┤ │ ├─┤ │
   *        └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘
   *         0 1 2 3 4
   *
   *  Rejection sampling method for this example do the following:
   *
   *  1- randomly find the potential observation k by using an uniform random
   *     function with lower limit 0 and upper limit 4.
   *     Lets say k = 0.
   *  2- draw a number x, from an unifrom random function with lower limit 0
   *     and upper limit p_max.
   *     Lets say x > p_0. In that case we restart the process from
   *     the begining.
   *  3- randomly find k.
   *     Lets say k = 2.
   *  4- randmly find x.
   *     Lets say x < p_2. In that case the process stop and
   *     the observation is returned.
   *
   *  Graphically, the following process can be represented as the following:
   *
   *   pmax ────┬─┬────
   *            │o│ ┌─┐
   *         x┌─┤ │ │ │
   *        ┌─┤ │ ├─┤ │
   *        └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘
   *         0 1 2 3 4
   *
   *  Where x represents the failed attempt and o the success one.
   *
   *  Intuitively we "see" the returned observations will match
   *  the underliying probabilities because observations with
   *  greater probability will have a higher chance of being returned
   *  than observation with lower one.
